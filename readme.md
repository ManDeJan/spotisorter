# Spotisorter

A set of scripts I made to sort your spotify playlist with ~ science.
Using certain metrics available with in the spotify api I sort a playlist
using the traveling salesman problem method. I made it so my playlists that
have a wide variety of genres make "sense" when listening. Music flows nicely
into each other without big changes in key/tempo/mood. If this is of use to
you let me know. :-)
